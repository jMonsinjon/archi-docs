=== Data Formats

==== *MUST* Use JSON as the Body Payload

JSON-encode the body payload. The JSON payload must follow https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7159[RFC-7159] by having (if possible) a serialized object as the top-level structure, since it would allow for future extension.
This also applies for collection resources where one naturally would assume an array.

==== *MUST* Use Standard Date and Time Formats

===== JSON Payload
Read more about date and time format in http://./json-guidelines.adoc#date-property-values-should-conform-to-rfc-3399[Json Guideline].

===== HTTP headers
Http headers including the proprietary headers. Use the http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-7.1.1.1[HTTP date format defined in RFC 7231].
