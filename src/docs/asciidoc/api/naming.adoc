=== API Naming

==== *MUST* Use lowercase separate words with hyphens for Path Segments

Example:

    /shipment-orders/{shipment-order-id}

This applies to concrete path segments and not the names of path parameters. For example `{shipment_order_id}` or `{shipmentOrderId}` would be ok as a path parameter.

==== *MUST* Use snake_case (never camelCase) for Query Parameters

Examples:

    customer_number, order_id, billing_address

==== *MUST* Use Hyphenated HTTP Headers

==== *MUST* Pluralize Resource Names

Usually, a collection of resource instances is provided (at least API should be ready here). The special case of a resource singleton is a collection with cardinality 1.

==== *MUST* Avoid Trailing Slashes

The trailing slash must not have specific semantics. Resource paths must deliver the same results
whether they have the trailing slash or not.
