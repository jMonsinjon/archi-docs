= Microservices characteristics

Here are the main characteristics of a microservice:

* Componentization, the ability to replace parts of a system, comparing with stereo components where each piece can be replaced independently from the others.
* Organisation around business capabilities instead of around technology.
* Smart endpoints and dumb pipes, explicitly avoiding the use of an Enterprise Service Bus (ESB).
* Decentralised data management with one database for each service instead of one database for a whole company.
* Infrastructure automation with continuous delivery being mandatory.

To be more specific, here are all the characteristics needed and implemented for our microservices:

* Built around a single (bounded) functional responsibility - DDD
* Atomically deployed
* Loosely coupled
* Autonomous lifecycle
* A reasonable code size: easy to replace
* Stateless
* Autonomous data management
* REST API
* Service discovery
* Distributed configuration

Here are the characteristics that could be improved in our architecture

* Organization in line with microservices structure
* Ability to version the API
* Auto scaling
* Delegates transverses responsibilities to third party management APIs


= Microservices @ Cdiscount

As teams need full responsibility of their code and configuration, all their services are built from the team's repository.
Discovery between services is specific to a team, all services deployed by a team will be mutually visible.
They are not visible to other teams, which need to go through your gateway to call the services you want to expose.

A team can handle one or more perimeters which are just a way to organize your containers in Marathon.


Here is a schema of our building blocks for a single team:
