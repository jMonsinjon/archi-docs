If you want to start right away creating a brand-new microservice, please read the http://a99build002/archi/archi-docs/latest/#how-to-a-fully-functional-microservice-in-10-minutes[How-to section].
However if you want a better look at how microservices are made at Cdiscount, please have a look at <<Understanding microservices>>

== Dev environment setup

NOTE: All software can be found on `\\tfsdropserver\Java`

.There are a few prerequesites to be able to work with Java environment and build microservices:
* Java Development Kit 8: pick the latest one or pick the one on the local share
* an IDE: the recommended choice is https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=windows[IntelliJ IDEA] but you might want to consider using https://spring.io/tools/sts/all[Spring Tool Suite] if you are familiar with Eclipse.

.Optional
* If you are more comfortable with the command line and do not want to use ide embedded Maven, use Maven 3.3.9 to build your projects. Installation instructions are https://maven.apache.org/install.html[here]

.Configuration
* Make your IntelliJ / Eclipse / STS use the previously installed JDK
* You need to use a special http://git.cdbdx.biz/archi/ide/blob/master/maven_settings.xml[maven settings] to be able to use our artifactory proxy
* To keep a consistent code format, we use an http://git.cdbdx.biz/archi/ide/blob/master/intellij-java-google-style.xml[IntelliJ formatter] or an http://git.cdbdx.biz/archi/ide/blob/master/eclipse-java-google-style.xml[Eclipse formatter].

Of course you will need to be familiar with <<Git Resources,Git>> to be more productive and efficient.

=== A note on code formatters

It always helps readability and maintainability if everyone follows some common guidelines. Our guidelines for http://git.cdbdx.biz/archi/ide/blob/master/intellij-java-google-style.xml[IntelliJ] or http://git.cdbdx.biz/archi/ide/blob/master/eclipse-java-google-style.xml[Eclipse] follow https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html[Google Style guidelines]. If you already are a Java expert you will probably be familiar with these guidelines but if you are new to Java you should take ten minutes to have a good look at them, specially at https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html#s5-naming[naming] if you're coming from C# world !

==== Importing code style in IntelliJ

1. Download http://git.cdbdx.biz/archi/ide/blob/master/intellij-java-google-style.xml[IntelliJ formatter]
1. Open IntelliJ settings (File -> Settings)
1. Go to code style settings (Editor -> Code Style)
1. Click on Manage and then Import and specify the downloaded IntelliJ settings file, as shown in the capture below.

==== Importing code style in Eclipse

1. Download http://git.cdbdx.biz/archi/ide/blob/master/eclipse-java-google-style.xml[Eclipse formatter]
1. Open Eclipse settings (Window -> Preferences)
1. Select Java/Code Style/Formatter.
1. CLick on import and select the downloaded Eclipse settings file.
