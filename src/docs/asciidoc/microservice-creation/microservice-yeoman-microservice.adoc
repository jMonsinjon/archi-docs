=== Cdiscount microservice generator

We built a generator to very easily generate a new microservice.
It will be a good starting point and will prevent you from having to put a lot of boilerplate code or configs and will save you a lot of efforts.

==== How to install the generator

The generator is currently a http://yeoman.io/[Yeoman] generator and as such, it requires you to have https://www.npmjs.com/[npm package manager] installed on your machine.

Here are all the steps needed to have a running microservice generator :

1. Install https://nodejs.org/en/[Node.js] which comes bundled with https://www.npmjs.com/[npm]. Node.js can run on pretty much any platform, Windows, Mac or Linux.
1. Install Yeoman command line `yo` by running :

[source, bash]
----
npm install -g yo
----

[start=3]
1. Check if you have curl in your path. If not, install https://curl.haxx.se/download.html[curl] library and
make sure you have it in your path by running.

[source, bash]
----
curl --version
----

If you still don't have it, add it to your environment variables.

[start=4]
1. Checkout the yeoman-microservice-generator Git project :

[source, bash]
----
git clone http://git.cdbdx.biz/git/archi/yeoman-microservice-generator.git
----

[start=5]
1. Go to your newly cloned generator directory and add it to Yeoman as a local generator :

[source, bash]
----
cd yeoman-microservice-generator
npm link
----

And that's it, you should be ready to use the generator !

==== How to use the generator

Very hard :

1. Go to the folder where you want to put your new application, e.g.:

[source, bash]
----
cd ~/my-workspace
----

[start=2]
1. Start the generation :

[source, bash]
----
yo microservice
----

... and just follow the instructions and answer the questions like in the above capture :

==== Sample outputs

Upon microservice genereator execution, you will see that a lot of files have been created. Below you'll find an example overview of all the created files, but keep in mind that files can change depending on the chosen options :

==== What's next ?

You can start developing your service, but when you need more information on how Cdiscount microservices work, you should refer to <<Understanding microservices>> section.

In particular, you might want to check how to handle configurations in the <<Working with configurations>> chapter or how to build & deploy in the <<Building and deploying your microservice>> chapter.
