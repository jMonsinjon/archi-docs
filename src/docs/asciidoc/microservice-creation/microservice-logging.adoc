=== Logging

==== Basics

In the CDS common architecture for java micro-services we made several choices concerning the logging technologies.
We use SLF4J as a logging facade and logback as a logger solution. We have a common logback configuration which adapt itself according to the application context.
This configuration is pulled if you inherit from one of the parent pom.

The log pattern is the following:
----
${logAppPerimeter}/${logPlatform}/${logFullAppName}/${HOSTNAME}: %d{yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.SSS} [${logFullAppName},%X{X-B3-TraceId:-},%X{X-B3-SpanId:-},%X{X-Span-Export:-}] [%thread] %-5level %logger{35} - %msg%n
----

.By default several appenders are activated:
* ConsoleAppender : for console output
* SyslogAppender : for syslog log aggregation (only enabled for marathon tasks)
* FileAppender : for file logging (not enabled for marathon tasks)

==== Log centralization
Log aggregation and centralisation is provided by syslog. Each log line is sent to the syslog agent installed on every docker.
This agent takes the responsibility to send the log to the syslog master on a99syslog001.
Syslog is then configured to do various things with the log.
First it write the log to files on the machine then it sends a copy to a logstash instance.
This instance then pre-filter the log line to extract common information (Silo, Platform, TraceId, ...) and redirect the logs to the team responsible of the message.
This team can then filter the message and send it to an elasticsearch index for example.

In case of "ERROR" or "WARNING" log level we also send a copy to a specific logstash responsible for error logs.
Currently it sends lines to a specific elasticsearch index to be rendered by the link:http://a99build002.cdweb.biz/#/alm/dashboard-bugs/latest[Bug Dashboard]

If you want to add log centralization for your team, you have to create your own logstash (see link:http://git.cdbdx.biz/ft-search/docker-monitoring-configuration/tree/master/logstash-conf/ft-search/syslog[ft search syslog's logstash configuration]) and ask for a VIP on the deployed instance.
When the VIP is available just submit a PR for link:http://git.cdbdx.biz/ft-search/docker-monitoring-configuration/tree/master/logstash-conf/archi/syslog[logstash configuration] to add an extra output to 03_outputs.conf.
