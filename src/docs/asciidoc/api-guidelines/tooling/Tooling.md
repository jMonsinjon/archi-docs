# Tooling

## API First Integrations

The following frameworks were specifically designed to support the API First workflow with OpenAPI YAML files (sorted alphabetically):

* [Connexion: OpenAPI First framework for Python on top of Flask](https://github.com/zalando/connexion)
* [Friboo: utility library to write microservices in Clojure with support for Swagger and OAuth](https://github.com/zalando-stups/friboo)
* [Api-First-Hand: API-First Play Bootstrapping Tool for Swagger/OpenAPI specs](https://github.com/zalando/api-first-hand)
* [Swagger Codegen: template-driven engine to generate client code in different languages by parsing Swagger Resource Declaration](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen)
* [Swagger Codegen Tooling: plugin for Maven that generates pieces of code from OpenAPI specification](https://github.com/zalando-stups/swagger-codegen-tooling)
* [Swagger Plugin for IntelliJ IDEA: plugin to help you easily edit Swagger specification files inside IntelliJ IDEA](https://github.com/zalando/intellij-swagger)

The Swagger/OpenAPI homepage lists more [Community-Driven Language Integrations](http://swagger.io/open-source-integrations/),
but most of them do not fit our API First approach.
