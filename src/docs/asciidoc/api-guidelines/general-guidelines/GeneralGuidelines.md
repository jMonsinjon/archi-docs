# General Guidelines

The titles are marked with the corresponding labels: {{ book.must }}, {{ book.should }}, {{ book.could }}.

## {{ book.must }} Follow API First Principle

As mentioned in the introduction, API First is one of our [engineering and architecture principles](https://github.com/zalando-incubator/zalando-tech-principles).
In a nutshell API First requires two aspects:

- define APIs outside the code first using a standard specification language
- get early review feedback from peers and client developers

By defining APIs outside the code, we want to facilitate early review feedback and also a development
discipline that focus service interface design on...

- profound understanding of the domain and required functionality
- generalized business entities / resources, i.e. avoidance of use case specific APIs
- clear separation of WHAT vs. HOW concerns, i.e. abstraction from implementation aspects — APIs should be stable even if we replace complete service implementation including its underlying technology stack

Moreover, API definitions with standardized specification format also facilitate...

- single source of truth for the API specification;
  it is a crucial part of a contract between service provider and client users
- infrastructure tooling for API discovery, API GUIs, API documents, automated quality checks

An element of API First are also this API Guidelines and a [lightweight API review process \[internal link\]](https://github.bus.zalan.do/ApiGuild/ApiReviewProcedure) as to get early review feedback from peers and client developers.
Peer review is important for us to get high quality APIs, to enable architectural and design alignment
and to supported development of client applications decoupled from service provider engineering life cycle.

It is important to learn, that API First is **not in conflict with the agile development principles** that we love.
Service applications should evolve incrementally — and so its APIs. Of course, our API specification will
and should evolve iteratively in different cycles; however, each starting with draft status and *early* team
and peer review feedback.
API may change and profit from implementation concerns and automated testing feedback.
API evolution during development life cycle may include breaking changes for not yet productive features
and as long as we have aligned the changes with the clients.
Hence, API First does *not* mean that you must have 100% domain and requirement understanding and can never produce code
before you have defined the complete API and get it confirmed by peer review. On the other hand, API First obviously is
in conflict with the bad practice of publishing API definition and asking for peer review after the service integration
or even the service productive operation has started.
It is crucial to request and get early feedback — as early as possible, but not before the API changes are comprehensive
with focus to the next evolution step and have a certain quality (including API Guideline compliance),
already confirmed via team internal reviews.


## {{ book.must }} Provide API Reference Definition using OpenAPI

We use the [OpenAPI specification](http://swagger.io/specification/) (aka Swagger spec) as standard for our REST API definitions.
You **have to provide the API definition in YAML format** (instead of JSON) for the OpenAPI API definition files due to its improved readability.

Please stick to version 2.0 of the specification for now, until we succeed to update all our tooling to support the upcoming version 3.0.

We also call the OpenAPI API definition the "API Reference definition" (or "API definition");
as a reference manual it provides all information needed by an experienced API client developer to use this API.

The OpenAPI API specification file should be subject of version control together with source code management.
Services also have to support an
[endpoint to access the API Reference definition](../api-operation/ApiOperation.md#must-Provide-Online-Access-to-OpenAPI-Reference-Definition) for their external API(s).

Furthermore you should make use of [Zally](https://github.com/zalando-incubator/zally),
our own API linter which supports you in designing a guideline compliant API.
You find more information in the Github repository itself and in
[API review procedures \[internal link\]](https://pages.github.bus.zalan.do/ApiGuild/ApiReviewProcedure/).
